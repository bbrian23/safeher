# SafeSpace Extension - Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** December 2024

## Overview

SafeSpace ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the SafeSpace browser extension.

## Data Collection and Storage

**SafeSpace does NOT collect, sell, or transfer any user data to third parties.** All extension data is stored locally in your browser on your device.

## Local Storage

The extension stores the following data locally on your device using Chrome's local storage:

- **OpenRouter API Key**: Only if you choose to provide it in the extension settings. This is stored locally and used exclusively to make API calls to OpenRouter's service.
- **Alert History**: Records of safety alerts generated by the extension for your review.
- **Extension Settings**: Your preferences including monitoring settings and auto-hide options.
- **Privacy Policy Analysis Cache**: Cached privacy policy analyses for websites you visit (to avoid redundant analysis).
- **Blocked Account Lists**: Accounts you have chosen to block through the extension.

**Important**: All of this data remains on your device and is never transmitted to our servers or any third-party servers (except OpenRouter when you use their API).

## Third-Party Services

### OpenRouter API

If you choose to provide an OpenRouter API key:
- Content analysis requests are sent **directly from your browser** to OpenRouter's API service
- SafeSpace does not intercept, store, or have access to the content of these API calls
- You are subject to OpenRouter's privacy policy and terms of service
- You can revoke access at any time by removing your API key from the extension settings

## Data Transmission

- **No data is sent to SafeSpace servers** - we do not operate any servers that collect user data
- **No analytics or tracking** - the extension does not track your browsing behavior
- **No telemetry** - we do not collect usage statistics or error reports

## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:

- **Storage**: To save your settings and alert history locally
- **activeTab**: To analyze content on the current webpage for safety threats
- **tabs**: To identify and close dangerous tabs when high-risk content is detected
- **webNavigation**: To trigger privacy policy analysis when visiting new websites
- **scripting**: To inject content analysis scripts
- **Host Permissions (all websites)**: To analyze content across all websites for safety threats

These permissions are used exclusively for the extension's safety features and do not involve data collection or transmission.

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:

- **View your data**: All stored data can be viewed through the extension's interface
- **Delete your data**: Use the "Clear Cache" and "Clear All Alerts" buttons in the Settings tab
- **Remove API key**: Delete your OpenRouter API key from settings at any time
- **Uninstall**: Uninstalling the extension removes all locally stored data

## Children's Privacy

SafeSpace is designed to help protect users of all ages, including minors. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, regardless of age.
